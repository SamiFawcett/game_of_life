Once the project is opened, scroll to the bottom of the simulation, where the main

Simulate object. Once completed, run the simulate main method with the "livecells.txt" file or create your own
file with the give format below.

A single Cell: x,y
	ex. 13,37

A file could look like:
1,1
1,2
1,3
1,6
2,2
100,2
10,3
50,23

There is a cell generator class, if you are too lazy to type all the cells out.

Have fun.
